Hello all,

I'm currently setting up the X Window System on my home PC and facing some configuration challenges. I'm using a version of BSD Unix and trying to optimize the performance for my graphics hardware. I've already looked into several manuals and forums, but I'm still encountering issues with screen resolution and color depth settings.

The documentation I've found seems a bit outdated, and I'm wondering if anyone here has recent experience or tips they could share. Specifically, I'm looking for advice on the following files:

- xwindow_config.txt
- bsd_graphics_setup.zip
- color_depth_guide.pdf

Any help or pointers to up-to-date resources would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
John
